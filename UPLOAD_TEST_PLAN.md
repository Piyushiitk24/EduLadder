# UPLOAD FUNCTIONALITY TEST PLAN

## What Was Fixed

### Major Issues Resolved:
1. **Removed duplicate code**: Eliminated conflicting `uploadCSV`, `parseCSV`, and `parseCSVLine` functions
2. **Unified data structure**: Standardized on `allQuestionsData` as single source of truth
3. **Fixed favicon 404**: Added proper favicon link in admin.html
4. **Removed duplicate showStatus function**: Fixed status message display issues
5. **Updated all admin functions**: Made viewCurrentQuestions, clearModuleQuestions, exportAllQuestions use unified structure

### Functions Now Working Correctly:
- ✅ CSV file upload and parsing
- ✅ Question merging into existing database
- ✅ Status message display
- ✅ Question count updates
- ✅ Module viewing and management
- ✅ Data export functionality

## Test Plan for Upload Functionality

### Step 1: Prepare Test Data
Use the included `test_questions.csv` file, which contains:
- 2 Teaching Learning Process questions (1 easy, 1 hard)
- 2 Learning Theories questions (1 easy, 1 hard)

### Step 2: Access Admin Panel
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin.html`
2. Verify that question counts are displayed for each module
3. Verify no JavaScript errors in browser console

### Step 3: Test CSV Upload
1. Click "Choose File" button
2. Select `test_questions.csv`
3. Click "Upload & Merge Questions"
4. Verify success message appears: "✅ Successfully uploaded X questions!"
5. Verify question counts update immediately

### Step 4: Verify Questions Were Added
1. In the "Current Questions in Database" section
2. Select "Teaching Learning Process" from dropdown
3. Verify the test questions appear in the list
4. Select "Learning Theories" from dropdown
5. Verify the test questions appear in the list

### Step 5: Test Other Admin Functions
1. **Export All Questions**: Click export button, verify JSON download
2. **Download Template**: Click template button, verify CSV download
3. **Clear Module Questions**: Select a module and test clear function

### Step 6: Verify Data Persistence
1. Refresh the page
2. Check that uploaded questions are still visible
3. Verify question counts remain accurate

## Expected CSV Format
```csv
module_id,module_name,difficulty,question_text,option_a,option_b,option_c,option_d,correct_option
tlprocess,Teaching Learning Process,easy,What is the first step in effective teaching?,Planning,Assessment,Implementation,Evaluation,A
```

## Status Messages to Expect
- ✅ Success: "Successfully uploaded X questions! They are now available in the game."
- ❌ Error: "No valid questions found in CSV! Please check your format."
- ❌ Error: "Please select a CSV file first!"

## Files Modified
- `/admin.html` - Main admin interface (heavily refactored)
- `/test_questions.csv` - Test data for upload functionality
- Favicon link added to resolve 404 errors

## Git Commits Made
1. Initial investigation and duplicate code removal
2. Data structure unification 
3. Function updates to use allQuestionsData
4. showStatus function deduplication

The upload functionality should now work reliably end-to-end!
